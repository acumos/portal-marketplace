# How to contribute

## Filing bugs

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching existing [issues](https://github.com/pvorb/platon/issues).
- When reporting a new bug, be sure to add the version you are using.

## Contributing features

This project follows the [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.

- Please have a look at the list of [approved open issues](https://github.com/pvorb/platon/issues?label_name=approved)
  before starting development on a new feature.
- If your feature is not in the list, please open a new issue first where the usefulness of a new feature can be
  discussed.
- New features are developed on their own branch. Feature branch names start with `feature/` followed by a dash
  separated short description of the feature, e.g. `feature/atom-feed`. 
- When you start working on a new feature, leave a comment on the issue with a link to the branch in your fork.
- When you think your feature is ready to be merged, create a Merge Request with a list of the changes in your feature.

## Coding conventions

[Google JavaScript Style](http://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml) with the following exceptions:

- Column limit: 120 characters
