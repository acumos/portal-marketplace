Portal Marketplace Developer Guide
==================================

What is MarketPlace?
====================

Acumos provides a toolkit-independent 'App Store', called
a Marketplace for:

   #. Data-powered decision making and artificial intelligence software
      models.

   #. It provides a means to securely share AI microservices along with
      information on how they perform, such as ratings, popularity statistics
      and user-provided reviews to apply crowd sourcing to software
      development..

   #. The platform provides integration between model developers and
      applications in order to automate the process of user feedback,
      exception handling and software updates..

Target Users
============
