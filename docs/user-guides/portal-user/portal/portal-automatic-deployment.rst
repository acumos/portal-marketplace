Automatic Deployment
======================

The goal of this feature is to trigger the launch of a Jenkins job automatically. 
Some specifics Jenkins jobs must be created by the Acumos user and then, based on some parameters that must be fullfiled by Acumos users like : ip adress of the jenkins server, jenkins login and security token, etc â€¦ (see Portal and Marketplace Admin guide section 9 ), Acumos will trigger these Jenkins jobs. This functionality can be used with Web onboarding through the Acumos UI or with onboarding by CLI with acumos-python-client, acumos-r-client and acumos-java-client. 
Deployment of the model is performed by the Jenkins Jobs, not by Acumos.
