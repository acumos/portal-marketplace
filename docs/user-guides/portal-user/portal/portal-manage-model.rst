Sharing a Model with a Team
===========================

A Modeler can share a model with anyone who has an account on his/her local
Acumos. When you share a model with a collaborator, you make that Modeler a
co-owner of the model. This means they have all the same capabilities as
the original owner. An overview is shown below.

The steps to share are as follows:

1. First, select the **Share with Team** tab under **MANAGEMENT OPTIONS**

2. Next, where you see **Find a user to Share with**, type in the user ID
   of the person with whom you wish to share. You will need to get that user
   ID from them. The UI will show suggestions based on the characters
   you have typed. Once you have located the correct person, select the
   **Share** button

3. The **Share with Team** will update. You will see that your
   model is shared and you have added collaborators.

The collaborator will receive a notification that a new model has
been shared with him/her.

==========================
Model owners have the ability to add different publisher name and the details of additional authors

After you fill in the required fields, click **Add author**.


Publishing a Model
==================

The publisher can create the number of catalogs in his instance, and using access level option 
he can restrict it to display in the marketplace. 

Users can publish one model in different catalogs and they can customize the information based 
on their needs. There are two types of access level Acumos has provided.

1. Public: Using this access level option publisher can allow his catalog access in the marketplace for the users. There is no condition to accessing these catalogs for the user whether they are logged-in or not.

2. Restricted: Using this access level option publisher can restrict the catalog access for the marketplace users. For accessing these catalogs user has to login to Acumos. 
   
The presentation of the models may be different in the marketplace to meet the needs of the 
different communities. For example, a user may wish to provide company-specific details to 
their colleagues inside their Company instance. This may include proprietary information, 
documents or details that are only relevant to colleagues using the Company instance. Information 
published to the restricted catalogs is contained within the company firewall.
