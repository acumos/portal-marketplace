Overview
========

The Acumos Marketplace is designed to make it easy to discover, explore, and use AI models. 
In addition to displaying models from the local platform’s catalog, the Public Marketplace 
can be configured to display models from peer Public Marketplaces. Users may view the details 
of a peer Model. However, users aren’t able to work with, download, or deploy a peer Model 
without first requesting access to use that model. Public Marketplace peer relationships 
are set up and managed by the administrators of each Acumos instance.


The Marketplace only displays Public catalog models to users who have not logged in.
 There is no option to display models from marketplaces other than Public.
